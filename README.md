# LaTeX Workshop
LaTeX Workshop given at FCUP in December 2022 (together with [João Dionísio](https://github.com/Joao-Dionisio))

The most polished document is the `cheat_sheet.tex` file, that we recommend reading for anyone wanting to know the very basics of LaTeX.

The repository also includes an article example and a beamer example, containing some of the basic LaTeX commands, that were used during the workshop itself, and are less suitable to being read by themselves.
